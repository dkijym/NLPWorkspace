Dr. William Schell will examine my knee tomorrow. Apoorv is going to CCLS tomorrow. He also has an appointment with the doctor. The tagger didn't detect Apoorv as a proper noun! But my name Apoorv is a proper noun. OK let us try some other name - Owen. Wow! now it detected Owen's name as a nation. I  want to see a proper name the way it is. Lets try this. The name of the doctor is Dr. William Schell. He is a graduate from Stanford University.
