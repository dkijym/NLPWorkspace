If both emails belong to the same user one can replace all references to either domain with a single domain.\n"
						+ "First click on \"refresh domain list\" button. Choose relevant names and click on the \"copy to list\" button. This can also be done manually using the percent (%) as a wildcard. For example %.columbia.edu will replace \"*anything*.Columbia.edu\". Be sure to fill in the target domain box. For example, if you choose the target: single.columbia.edu  and click on \"Click to convert to\" button to enter your choice and this action will clean up the data. \n"
						+ "c) The user can switch to the SQL view window to run the \"clean data\" button. This will remove any invalid data (in case the parser was interrupted by unexpected characters or email formats. \n"
						+ "\nOn the bottom of the LoadDB window, a report is generated with an overview of the current database. The report is refreshed at every new parsing session, or can be done manually. The \"Report to clipboard\" moves the information to the system clipboard.\n"
						+ "2.	Message Window\n"
						+ "Click the Message window to reveal a view of the data. To show new data, choose a pattern of data and click Refresh. Patterns are used to load data into the Java window. By default the database will load up with a date range which includes around 400 messages.\n"
						+ "As an example pattern, specify a specific folder name (file parsed), either a date period or all dates, and click on \"refresh\".\n"
						+ "One can test a data view before actually fetching it by clicking on \"general info\" button. A window will appear showing how many records will be fetched by the refresh and some information on the current table size.\n"
						+ "In the case where the user clicks on \"refresh\" and no data appears, check that the period between the dates at the top of the window reflects the data in the database. If the data view is selected as \"date bounded\", and no data falls between the selected dates, no data will appear.\nOnce data appears a single left mouse click will refresh the message window on the bottom and double-clicking will bring up more information. \nMultiple records can be chosen either through shift click, mouse drag or ctrl+click. \nTo sort a specific column in ascending order, click on the column name. For example click on the subject column to sort all emails by subject line. To reverse sort, click on the column while holding down the \"shift\" key (any shift key).\nMore options are available when right mouse clicking on a selected record. For example a message or range of messages can be moved between folders, printed, copied to clipboard, or labeled.\n"
						+ "3.	Viewing Email Attachment Information \nAttachments can be studied in the \"Attachment statistics\" window. Click on \"attachment list\" button to refresh the attachment list, either at startup or when loading in new email data. The list is sorted in alphabetical order. \nChoosing an attachment, will update the metrics table, and \"seen in\" table. The metrics can be recalculated by click on Compute Statistics and Alerts to update the statistical information. This process may take a few minutes, during which the buttons becomes inactive and a popup progress bar will note progress.\nWhen the buttons becomes active again, choose an attachment from the list in order to see information about it stored in the database. The \"Null\" symbol represents emails with no attachments. You must update the alert function thresholds in order to generate the appropriate automatic alerts to the Alert Table window. This may be done through the top menu by clicking Tools Alert Options.  \n"
						+ "4.	Email Features\n"
						+ "The Email Feature window allows the user to specify system wide settings to affect modeling and other tasks in EMT. Among the options are:\nTarget class: this is the class label associated with a set of selected emails considered training data to learn a classifier. Although the classifier will learn (usually) two target classes, it is helpful to calculate how well it does vis a vis the target class label.\n"
						+ "\"Stop list\" is the list of words EMT will ignore when computing content based features. \"Keyword list\" is the list used to group the contents of the messages in the message grouping function. \"Type of attachment\" indicates the type of attachment to be analyzed in the learning models. \"Force lower case\" will force the email body content to be analyzed in lower case only. \nThere is a drop down list labeled \"select sample data\" which will affect the data displayed in the bottom panel. Here we are choosing the feature set to be used in the Naive Bayes modeling in the message window.\n"
						+ "5.	Learning in the Message Window.\nBy default, all new data are classified as unknown. This means that the class column in the database is set at \"?\" or \"u\". In this example, in order for EMT to perform machine learning, some of the data has to be labeled as a target class (example) \"spam\" (\"s\") while other data are labeled \"not interesting\" (\"n\").  The labeling process can be accomplished in one of three ways: via a manual setting, via the Message window, and via SQL changes to the database. \nBring up a folder in the window. Label all the examples, either through choosing a group of messages with the mouse and \"right click\" and choose \"label\". Or by manually labeling each one with the class column drop down list. That is by clicking on the current label (\"unknown\") and choosing an appropriate label.\n"
						+ "Before running a learning algorithm, switch to the \"email feature\" window, and make sure the current features are the ones you want. See the \"email feature\" section for more information.\nSide note: Certain features are inappropriate for Naive Bayes learning. For example, a feature such as mailref is not conducive to learning which email is \"interesting,\" since the mailref has an arbitrarily assigned code without meaning. The mailref is a unquie identifier used to differentiate distinct emails.\nClick on build model, specify a model name, choose learning type (see help button). Then click on train. A ROC curve showing how the model evaluated over the training data will appear at the end of the training process.\nTo evaluate a classifier or model, load up another view of unlabelled email data, choose \"eval mode\", specify the model name, and see how the chosen classifier labels the examples automatically.\n"
						+ "a.	Common Learning Errors\nSome of the learning algorithms only accept numeric features, while some only accept string features, and some accept both.  A pop-up window will appear with an error message if you try to run an algorithm that has incompatible features.  \n"
						+ "Each algorithm requires a minimal number of labeled messages as examples. If you have labeled too few messages, then you will see a pop-up window indicating that there is an insufficient amount of labeled data. \n"
						+ "6.	Interesting Users\n"
						+ "To locate \"Interesting\" users, open the Similar Users window. Select either senders or all users. Select a user from the drop-down list and click Find Similar Accts. You may be able to locate more users by adjusting the slider to a lower level. Click on the user account name to bring up a usage graph for each of the users determined to be similar to the target user's histogram. In addition, you can click Find All User Groups to find all groups of similar users. These options enable you to get a general idea about the users' email usage behavior. \n"
						+ "7.	Screen Capture / Printing\nThis version of EMT does not have screen capture capabilities.  To create a snapshot of what is seen on the screen, use the screen capture functionality available in Windows. Click the Alt-Print Screen buttons, and Windows will capture the current active window. In addition, you may click Print Screen to capture the entire screen.\nThere is also cut-and-paste functionality available in some of the table displays. Use the Windows keyboard shortcuts to copy (Ctrl-c) and paste (Ctrl-v) to copy selected data from a table to another application. You can also copy the entire test table to the clipboard as text by clicking the Copy to Clipboard button in the Testing Area window.\n"
						+ "8.	Usage histograms\nIn this window, one can track anomalous behavior over time. First choose the sender email. Note that by default the top \"only senders\" is checked off. We define sender here to be those email accounts which have a min of 200 outgoing emails. To see all email users click on \"all users\". \nSelect  a user's email, notice that the text label on the right of the email will now show how many emails and the range of available dates. Now click on show histogram. If there is an anomalous behavior, an alert will be shown at the bottom of the window, and alert generated in the alert table. \nThere is a slider labeled \"alert level\" which reflects a threshold of how different the recent actions can be in order to generate an alert. \nNow either choose the same user or another, click on \"Run against all users\". This will compare the current user to all others.\n\"Generate report\" will run a report using the training/testing range for each of the users.\nIf any user's recent email behavior is deemed anomalous, an alert will be reported to the report window.\n"
						+ "9.	Cliques of users\nEMT allows the exploration of cliques generated by everyday usage of email systems. The basic concept encompasses the idea that email systems reflect an underlying social structure between users. Three windows, allow the user to view email cliques in somewhat different views. \n"
						+ "a.	Enclave cliques\nThis window, implements \"Finding All Cliques of an Undirected Graph\" by Bron & Kerbosch (1971). The basic idea is to find all groups of user exchanging at least \"X\" emails pairwise. The parameter X can be set in the top of the window.  \nTo see the cliques, hit the \"Refresh\" button. This can take a few minutes on a very large data set. \nWhat is displayed is a list of users who appear in each clique, along with common subject words which appear on all the emails.\n"
						+ "b.	User Cliques\nThese cliques are from a user's point of view. By choosing an individual user, one can see how their email is spread over time. Each black bar is a year division in the graph. \nIf the user list is empty, click on \"refresh users\". Now choose a user. The email history will appear to show the distributions of emails from a particular email user.\n\"clique violations\" shows all violated cliques in the testing period compared to what is seen in the training period. \"clique sets\" show all cliques seen during the training session. In addition a weight is shown which calculates how often a single user has been seen in all email correspondence. A clique composed of frequent users will have greater weight than a clique with infrequent users.\n"
						+ "c.	Graphic Cliques\nThis is a visual representation of the enclave cliques. In addition a second somewhat faster but simpler clique algorithm is implemented instead of what is used in the enclave clique window.\n"
						+ "10.	Email Flow\nThis section allows one to follow the path an email and the subsequent replies it generates over time. The user selects a particular user account, and a particular email sent from that account. EMT will automatically find all \"similar\" emails exchanged between any email accounts in the future. The display shows the original seed email as the center dot. Each concentric ring corresponds to the time of the next email appearing in the flow. Each subsequent dot and arc displays the entire flow. The user can navigate thru this flow simply by clicking on nodes and arcs and reading the emails in the pane at the bottom of the window. \n"
						+ "11.	Recipient frequency \nThis window allows one to profile an email account to look for interaction of a single user to all recipients of that user.\nChoose an email address to study. Click on profile to see the profile of the user. \nOn the top left you see a histogram of the frequency of communication for each recipient. The table on the top right displays the statistics that are plotted on the left. \nOn the bottom left, is a plot of how new addresses are seen over time of the email history. On the bottom right is a plot of attachment behavior over time. \nNow click on \"chi square\" to compare a training period against a test period for the user. This functions depends on the amount of data available for the user. The basic idea is to choose a period of time as the \"normal time\" of the user that will be tested against a user chosen \"test period\" to determine if the user's email behavior has changed unexpectedly.\nNow click on the \"cs+cliques\" button. On first use, it will compute the cliques, and then display the user data based on cliques. (see clique section). \nFinally the \"hellinger\" button creates a hellinger distance measurement to spot unexpected email behavior (rather than using the Chi Square test). \nThe \"test\" button on the top of the window, allows one to simulate a virus propagation in the user's email. Different metrics are used and displayed showing how to detect the simulated viral emails interspersed in the user's email data.\nTo get an interesting users, click on \"sort users desc\" button to sort the most freq user first. This will reorder the list in order of number of records. The more records, the more accurate picture can be built to profile a user.\n"
						+ "12.	Average communication time\nThis section allows the user to examine which accounts are more important to the email user based on response behaviors. The theory is the quicker one responds to a person's email, the more important that person may be. \nChoose a user name, choose a date interval, click on run.\nThe plot is an ordered set of recipients, which the sender responds to an average email. You may expect to see at the top of the list the most important people of the selected user. \n"
						+ "13.  Report and forensic\n This section allows to review reports from other windows, and to explore all accounts in a way which ties them to each other through usage\n"
						+ "14.	SQL View\nThis window allows SQL queries. You can leave the default SQL that will fetch the first 50 records. Click on \"fetch\" to execute the current SQL command.\nFirst see if your data has any date issues, click on \"clean invalid dates\" and check the output.\nNow click on \"clean invalid data\" to clean out inconsistent data from the database. This action can sometimes take a while so please be patient.\nNow click on \"Optimize tables\" this will issue an SQL statement to recomputed the keys in the database. This will speed up some of the operations of EMT.\n\n");
