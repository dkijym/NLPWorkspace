EMT Source file readme - 2007


@author Shlomo Hershkop


welcome to the EMT source code.

EMT has been an ongoing effort since 2001, as such, things were created, modified, tweaked, retweaked, etc
other sections were added for specific requirements and never visited again.

originally there was a live system known as met coded in perl this was a system for tracking and analyzing attachments from email communication

it was modified for offline, and coded in java, that was EMT version 1 

to explore: start looking at winGui.java in the main metdemo directory

the welcome screen divides the different parts of EMT into logical groups

to compile on windows:
	install java 1.5+, make sure its in the path
	run: build.bat		this will compile the .java source into .class files
	run: makejar.bat	this will collect the .class files, and manifest file into single emt.jar file
	assuming you have all library jar files in lib subdirectory
	
	first time running: see emt README (or double click on emt.jar)
	next times: run the emtclient.bat file created
for large collections of emails, also install and setup mysql

to compile on linux/mac:
	edit the build.bat and makejar to replace the ';' with ':' (file seperators on unix.mac)
